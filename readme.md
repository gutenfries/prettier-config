# prettier-config
these are my personal [prettier](https://prettier.io) code formatting preferences.
# Installing/Usage
the only reason you're going to use this is becuase you know how to use prettier and you like my style, so I will skip over how to use it.
> Note: this is intended for the (Current as of 03/16/2022) latest stable release of [prettier](https://prettier.io) (v2.5.1).

This is served through the [GitHub Packages Registry](https://pkg.github.com) and NOT through [yarn](https://registry.yarnpkg.com) or [npm](https://registry.npmjs.org).
what this means for you is that you _can't_ just `yarn add` or `npm i` this.
you're going to have to create an `.npmrc` in the root of your project and add a [GitHub PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
